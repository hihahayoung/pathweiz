About

Description and Purpose  
Pathweiz is a web-based platform designed to help college students discover new career possibilities. By gathering user input, such as academic interests and personal hobbies, and then leveraging AI-generated recommendations, Pathweiz provides personalized career guidance that goes beyond the obvious. Its goal is to simplify the confusion surrounding career exploration by highlighting unique opportunities, actionable steps, and relevant resources that students can actually use.

Inspiration  
This project emerged from first-hand experiences and research into the career-related anxieties faced by college students, particularly those at Minerva University who navigate an interdisciplinary and global curriculum. Drawing from user feedback, existing career discovery tools, and innovative platforms like ‚ÄúGenius‚Äù for music interpretation, we realized the need for a similarly user-driven, adaptable resource that evolves with the user‚Äôs growth and changing job market landscapes. Our approach synthesizes personalized feedback, continuous updates, and tangible next steps, reminiscent of a supportive mentor or career coach you can access anytime.
